        seasonal_factor: Indicates the seasonal factor of each observation on your data set.

        tendence_component: Indicates the tendence component in the Holt-Winters model.
        seasonal_component: Indicates the seasonal component in the Holt-Winters model. It is a matrix whose first index is the seasonal index of a given time, and the second index is the season itself.
